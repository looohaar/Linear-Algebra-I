# Introduction to Linear Algebra

This repository covers the essentials of Linear Algera for Machine Learning and Deep Learning. This will be the first part of my Linear Algebra series. This part is divided into 3 Segments, which are as follows:

### Segment 1: Data Structures for Algebra

What Linear Algebra Is?

Tensors

Scalars

Vectors and Vector Transposition

Norms and Unit Vectors

Basis, Orthogonal, and Orthonormal Vectors

Arrays in NumPy

Matrices

Tensors in TensorFlow and PyTorch


### Segment 2: Common Tensor Operations

Tensor Transposition

Basic Tensor Arithmetic

Reduction

The Dot Product

Solving Linear Systems

### Segment 3: Matrix Properties


The Frobenius Norm

Matrix Multiplication

Symmetric and Identity Matrices

Matrix Inversion

Diagonal Matrices

Orthogonal Matrices
